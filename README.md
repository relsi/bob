# Bob - Open Source Trading Robot
Bob is a python algorithmic trading library to make robots that trade stocks and cryptocurrencies.

The objective of the project is to put into practice my learning in the flask python framework, AI and data science, besides facilitating my trading on the stock exchange. :)
